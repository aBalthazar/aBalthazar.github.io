*solo project // 2 months*

For a long time, I wanted to make a serious game for children based on the *goose game*. So I presented this idea to a jury and I won a prize which allowed me to pursue the production of this project.

I was responsible for :
- **Following the imposed milestones and deadlines**
- **Producing all the assets and animations**
- **Programming a reliable board game system based on tiles**
- **Respecting accessibility constraints (young audience)**
